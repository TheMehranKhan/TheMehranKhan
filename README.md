# a lil about me
**i love to make  software work, organized, optimized and clean.**
Pinned repos can be mine can be fork of what i've used, like azesmway's repo that we used to integrate a unity game into React Native app built with expo I'm also also Unity Developer and I make cool Augmented Reality games using AR Foundation and Location based games using mapbox, currently making high-performance match-making engine using Go and Ruby on Rails (not a match making engine for games with unity tho lol, it's a matchmaking engine for FINEX markets) and managing a team of devs.

you can find my links here, don't trust other ones people are crazy on the internet.
